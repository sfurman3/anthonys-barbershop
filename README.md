# Anthony's Barber Shop
`anthonys-barbershop-webpage` contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used in a
practice webpage I created (mostly) from scratch using content from the
[webpage of my local barber](http://www.langhornebarber.com/).

The related blog post and active web page can be found here: <https://sethfurman.github.io/web/progamming/2018/01/22/anthonys-barbershop.html>.
