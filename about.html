                                Classic and modern haircuts for boys and men along with hot towel, straight razor shaves. A traditional barber shop that has been here for almost 50 years. Freshly renovated with old school charm that reflects the history of the community. Come for a trim and relax to the sounds of Louis Prima, Jerry Vale, Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Dean Martin and others, while enjoying a refreshment from our vintage 1950's Philco refrigerator. All for the same price as the unisex chains. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We have been a barber shop since the mid 1960s, when the Langhorne Speedway was on the other side of Woodbourne Rd. The current owner is the third generation of his family to practice the Tonsorial Arts, and has recently taken the baton from the shop's previous owner, who has been here for 25 years.

                            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
                            
                            <h3>Haircut &amp; Style</h3>
                            <p>
                                Every haircut is executed with precision and style, and always finished with a hot lather neck shave. A commercial and fine artist before becoming a barber, Anthony finds that giving a fresh haircut is much like executing a painting or sculpture, and treats each one as such.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Classic Shaves</h3>
                            <p>
                                We apply a hot towel and pre-shave cream to ensure you get the closest and most comfortable shave possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We pride ourselves on using razors passed down to us from barbers of long ago. Chances are your face will be shaved with a 90 year old, freshly honed straight razor once used by the late Nick Seruby (a Trenton New Jersey barber) but not before it gets the finishing touch on a 100 year-old strop that was used by Anthony’s grandfather and great-grandfather. At the end of the shave, a quick shoulder massage with his grandfather’s Oster Stim-u-lax massager from the 1950’s and you will be relaxed and ready for the rest of 
the day.
